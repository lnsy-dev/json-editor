## Installation

Clone the Repository: 

To install the project dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:lnsy-dev/pochade-js.git
```

or use the  "Use Template" function on Github and clone that repository.

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Project

To run the project in development mode, use the following command:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will start a development server. By default, it runs on port 3000. You can view the project in your browser.

## Building the Project

To build the project for production, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` folder with the bundled and optimized files.

## Customizing the Build

You can customize the build output by creating a `.env` file in the root of the project.

### Output Filename

To change the name of the output file, set the `OUTPUT_FILE_NAME` variable in your `.env` file.

**.env**
```
OUTPUT_FILE_NAME=my-custom-filename.js
```

If this variable is not set, the output file will default to `dist/main.min.js`.

### Development Server Port

You can also change the development server port by setting the `PORT` variable in your `.env` file.

**.env**
```
PORT=8080
```

If this variable is not set, the port will default to `3000`.
